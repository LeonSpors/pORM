**pORM** is a performance-oriented, lightweight ORM mapper for .NET. It’s designed for developers who want a minimal and efficient way to map SQL query results to objects and perform CRUD operations without the overhead of a full-featured ORM.

## Features

- **Lightweight & Minimal:** Focused on performance and simplicity.
- **Easy Mapping:** Maps SQL query results to POCOs using reflection.
- **LINQ-to-SQL Translator:** Built-in expression translator for simple query expressions.
- **Asynchronous Support:** Async methods for executing SQL commands.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be extended and customized for your needs.

## Installation

You can install **pORM** via NuGet:

```powershell
Install-Package pORM
```

Or with the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package pORM
```

*Note: pORM is currently under heavy development, and breaking changes may be introduced in future releases.
